# Seizure Detection in Canine Subjects
### Tyler Blevins

EEG from four canine subjects was analyzed. The EEG data is publicly available (and nicely packaged/organized) on Kaggle.com as part of the Seizure Detection challenge. The data was clipped into 1 second segments and classified as 'Ictal' or Interictal'. Features derived from the literature will be extracted from the clips, analyzed for importance, and ran through a seizure detection algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by ROC and AUC metrics.
