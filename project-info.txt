The final project will answer a question selected by each student using publicly available biomedical data and some of the tools presented during the course. After students choose the topic to address on their own, each will identify three faculty/staff scientists/postdocs from different departments/fields to get feedback and help define a specific novel and interdisciplinary question. Students will work on these projects throughout the semester. Identification of topics is due 9/18/15 as part of course assignment 2. Project proposals with specific questions to be addressed are due 10/16/15 as part of course assignment 4. Final project reports are due 11/30/15. Grading will be based on three project components: (1) proposal that includes a novel interdisciplinary question and feedback provided by 3 diverse experts, (2) an R markdown document that describes the question, source of data, analysis, and results, and (3) a 10 minute oral presentation describing the work to classmates.
